<h4>Statistical Modeling of the Microbiome</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I work with <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Daniela Witten</a> and 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/adwillis/">Amy Willis</a> to develop methods for proper statistical analysis of the microbiome. 
  I am the developer of corncob, a regression model and hypothesis testing procedure developed 
  to address the challenges of microbiome data, implemented as an R software package. Our proposal uses observed absolute abundance information to 
  make inference about the latent microbial population. The article is accepted to appear in <i>Annals of Applied Statistics</i>,
  and is currently available <a href = "https://www.imstat.org/journals-and-publications/annals-of-applied-statistics/annals-of-applied-statistics-next-issues/">here</a>.
  The software is available 
  <a href = "https://github.com/bryandmartin/corncob">here</a>.
  <br/>
  I have also worked on <a href = "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/21/305045">DivNet</a>, 
  a method for estimating alpha and beta diversity of microbial communities when taxa interact via an ecological network.
  The software for implementing DivNet is available <a href = "https://github.com/adw96/DivNet">here</a>.

<h4>Small-Area Spatio-temporal Modeling</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I also work on developing spatio-temporal models for under-five mortality estimation with complex survey data 
  with a group led by  <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/">Jon Wakefield</a> and  
  <a href = "https://sociology.osu.edu/people/clark.2962">Sam Clark</a>. <br/>
  Check out our R package on CRAN, <a href = "https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SUMMER">SUMMER</a>, 
  for all your spatio-temporal modeling with complex survey data needs!
