<h3> Overview and Course Philosophy </h3>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  Computational and data analysis skills are beneficial in any field where data exists (basically all of them!),
  and are absolutely essential to modern statistics. 
  This course aims to help you build a foundation for these skills and develop them to a practical level.
  The role of statisticians and data analysts is to go beyond being consumers of statistical software and methods.
  Real world data are usually more challenging than what we see in classrooms.
  Properly tackling analyses of such data often requires that we develop and build our own tools, 
  and do so in a way that others are able to use and even extend our methods.
  <br/>
  Students are assumed to have an introductory knowledge of statistics, but no formal computational training.
  All material is taught using the R statistical programming language. This course emphasizes:
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <b>Application over theory:</b> 
    There is a plethera of great courses at UW that will teach you statistical theory; this course is not among them.
    We will briefly touch on and review statistical concepts to the extent that they are needed,
    but it is important to be able to transition from the classroom to the workplace. 
    This course aims to help you do that by moving from statistical theory to statistical practice.
    It's been a long time since anyone was paid to look up a p-value in a table in the back of a book!
