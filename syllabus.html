<h3> Overview and Course Philosophy </h3>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  Computational and data analysis skills are beneficial in any field where data exists (basically all of them!),
  and are absolutely essential to modern statistics. 
  This course aims to help you build a foundation for these skills and develop them to a practical level.
  The role of statisticians and data analysts is to go beyond being consumers of statistical software and methods.
  Real world data are usually more challenging than what we see in classrooms.
  Properly tackling analyses of such data often requires that we develop and build our own tools, 
  and do so in a way that others are able to use and even extend our methods.
  <br/><br/>
  Students are assumed to have an introductory knowledge of statistics, but no formal computational training.
  All material is taught using the R statistical programming language. This course emphasizes: <br/><br/>
  
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;" > <h5 style="display: inline;">Application over theory:</h5> 
    There is a plethera of great courses at UW that will teach you statistical theory; this course is not among them.
    We will briefly touch on and review statistical concepts to the extent that they are needed,
    but it is important to be able to transition from the classroom to the workplace. 
    This course aims to help you do that by moving from statistical theory to statistical practice.
    It's been a long time since anyone was paid to look up a p-value in a table in the back of a book!

  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;" > <h5 style="display: inline;">Coding best practices:</h5> 
    Whenever you code, whether it be for a class, job, or anything else, 
    you will save yourself a lot of time and trouble by learning and using modern best practices.
    If anyone else ever interacts with your code, you will save them a lot of pain as well.
    We will dedicate a substantial amount of course time to concepts such as commenting, 
    style, documentation, version control, and more.
    These skills might seem tedious at first, but it is much, much easier to learn them straightaway rather than
    practice doing things the quick and easy way and have to change how you do things later!
  </li><br/>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;" > <h5 style="display: inline;">"Real world" experience:</h5> 
    Of course, this a class, and you will be in a classroom, 
    so we cannot possibly replicate all aspects of data analysis in practice.
    However, we will work directly with messy data, debugging, and code review.
    The course projects will emphasize taking the tools we learn and develop throughout the course and 
    applying them to realistic data scenarios.
    A well-designed and well-implemented project is something that boost a resume, 
    and demonstrate to potential employers that you have practical experience and training. 
    You can see this <a class="active" href="images/projectresume.png">small example</a> from my own undergraduate resume as an example.

<h3> Classroom Environment </h3>
<b><i>I am absolutely committed to fostering a safe, inclusive classroom environment in which all students have 
  equal opportunity to learn and succeed.</b></i>
</br>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    <h5 style="display: inline;">Names & Pronouns:</h5>
    Everyone deserves to be addressed respectfully and correctly. 
    You are welcome to send me your preferred name and correct gender pronouns at any time.
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    <h5 style="display: inline;">Diversity:</h5>
    Diverse backgrounds, embodiments, and experiences are essential to the critical thinking endeavor at the heart of
    university education. Therefore, I expect you to follow the UW Student Conduct Code in your interactions with your
    colleagues and me in this course by respecting the many social and cultural differences among us, which may include,
    but are not limited to: age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity, family status, gender identity and 
    presentation, citizenship and immigration status, national origin, race, religious and political beliefs, sex,
    sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and veteran status.</li>

      <h5 style="display: inline;">Accomodations:</h5>
      Your experience in this class is important to me. 
      If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS),
      please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can
      discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through DRS, 
      but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations
      (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision,
      hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or uwdrs@uw.edu
      or disability.uw.edu.
      DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities 
      and/or temporary health conditions.  Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive
      process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS.  It is the policy and practice of 
      the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments
      consistent with federal and state law.</li>
