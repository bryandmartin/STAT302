<h3> Overview and Course Philosophy </h3>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  Computational and data analysis skills are beneficial in any field where data exists (basically all of them!),
  and are absolutely essential to modern statistics. 
  This course aims to help you build a foundation for these skills and develop them to a practical level.
  The role of statisticians and data analysts is to go beyond being consumers of statistical software and methods.
  Real world data are usually more challenging than what we see in classrooms.
  Properly tackling analyses of such data often requires that we develop and build our own tools, 
  and do so in a way that others are able to use and even extend our methods.
  <br/><br/>
  Students are assumed to have an introductory knowledge of statistics, but no formal computational training.
  All material is taught using the R statistical programming language. This course emphasizes: <br/><br/>

    <h4 style="display: inline;">Application over theory:</h4> 
    There is a plethera of great courses at UW that will teach you statistical theory; this course is not among them.
    We will briefly touch on and review statistical concepts to the extent that they are needed,
    but it is important to be able to transition from the classroom to the workplace. 
    This course aims to help you do that by moving from statistical theory to statistical practice.
    It's been a long time since anyone was paid to look up a p-value in a table in the back of a book!

  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;" > 
    <h4 style="display: inline;">Coding best practices:</h4> 
    Whenever you code, whether it be for a class, job, or anything else, 
    you will save yourself a lot of time and trouble by learning and using modern best practices.
    If anyone else ever interacts with your code, you will save them a lot of pain as well.
    We will dedicate a substantial amount of course time to concepts such as commenting, 
    style, documentation, version control, and more.
    These skills might seem tedious at first, but it is much, much easier to learn them straightaway rather than
    practice doing things the quick and easy way and have to change how you do things later!
  </li><br/>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;" > 
    <h4 style="display: inline;">"Real world" experience:</h4> 
    Of course, this a class, and you will be in a classroom, 
    so we cannot possibly replicate all aspects of data analysis in practice.
    However, we will practice working with messy data, debugging, and collaboration.
    The course projects will emphasize taking the tools we learn and develop throughout the course and 
    applying them to realistic data scenarios.
    A well-designed and well-implemented project is something that boost a resume, 
    and demonstrate to potential employers that you have practical experience and training. 
    You can see this <a class="active" href="images/projectresume.png">small example</a> from my own undergraduate resume as an example.

<h3> Course Structure </h3>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  Typically, each 80 minute class session will be broken up into a 45 minute lecture, 5 minute break, and 30 minute lab.
  Lab time is an opportunity for you to regularly practice your coding, work on assigments collaboratively,
  and get help from me. </br></br>

  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    <h4 style="display: inline;">Short Labs:</h4>
  On most Mondays, you will be assigned Short Labs. These are designed for you to be able to complete, or nearly complete, 
  during class hours. They will be due at the start of the next class and will be graded on the following 2 point scale:</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 80px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
  <b>0:</b> indicates incomplete or unacceptable work </li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 80px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
  <b>1:</b> indicates a good faith effort towards completing >75% of the assignment </li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 80px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
  <b>2:</b> indicates a good faith effort towards completing the entire assignment. </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: 0em; padding-left: 3em; list-style-type:none;"> 
    At the end of the quarter, your lowest Short Lab grade will be dropped.</li></br>
  

  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    <h4 style="display: inline;">Labs:</h4>
  On most Wednesdays, you will be assigned Labs. These are more involved assignments that you likely will not be able to 
complete during class hours. They will be due at the start of the next class.</li></br>

  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    <h4 style="display: inline;">Projects:</h4>
Instead of exams, you will be assigned three projects throughout the course. All projects will include at least two lab sessions.</li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 80px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    <b>Project 1</b> focuses on data manipulation and visualization. You will be given 1 week to complete this project. </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 80px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    <b>Project 2</b> focuses on statistical modeling and inference. You will be given 1 week to complete this project. </li> 
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 80px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    <b>Project 3</b> focuses on software development and a cumulative application of course material.
    You will be given 2 weeks to complete this project, including finals week. </li> </br>

  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    <h4 style="display: inline;">Late Work:</h4>
    Any assignment that is received late but less than 24 hours late will receive a grade penalty of 25%.
    Any assignment that is received 24&ndash;48 hours late will receive a grade penalty of 50%.
    Assignments will not be accepted more than 48 hours late.
</p>

<h3> Grading </h3>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  Your final grade will be calculuated as follows: </p>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    15%: Short Labs </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    25%: Labs </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    10%: Your minimum grade from Project 1 and Project 2 </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    20%: Your maximum grade from Project 1 and Project 2 </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 40px 0px; text-indent: -1.45em; padding-left: 3em;"> 
    30%: Project 3 </li>
 <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
   The final grades will be curved, <i>but only to help you!</i> 
  Consistent and excellent work will <i>always</i> be rewarded with an excellent grade, 
  regardless of the performance of the rest of the class.
