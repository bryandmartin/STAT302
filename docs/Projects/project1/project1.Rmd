## Instructions

For this project, we will be exploring and visualization data from [www.boardgamegeek.com](www.boardgamegeek.com).

This project is intentionally open-ended.
Exceptional projects will include interesting and unique insight and analysis into this data.
I encourage you to use [this 538 post](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/designing-the-best-board-game-on-the-planet/) for inspiration, but please do not just copy their graphs and analyses.

You may work with partner for this project if you choose. 
If you do so, you must both submit the same .Rmd and .html files on Canvas with both of your names at the top.
