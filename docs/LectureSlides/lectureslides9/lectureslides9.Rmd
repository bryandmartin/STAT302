---

* repeating a task : writing a function ::
writing a function : writing a package
* If you find yourself copying R code from one script file to another, it's probably worth it to write a package!
* Copying and pasting code as part of your workflow is **bad** practice!

# Getting Started (*)

First, we need to make sure you have the proper packages installed.
Remember, do this step only once!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr", "covr"))
```

---

# Step 1: Create the directory (*)

1. Within your `STAT302` directory, go to your folder for projects
2. Create a new subdirectory, `Project3` (or similar)
3. **Change your working directory within R to your `Project3` subfolder!**
4. Type in your R console (changing the package name)
  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
  devtools::create("YOURPACKAGENAME")
  ```
  I don't care what you name your package. Unless you feel particularly inspired, feel free to go for `myfirstpackage`, `STAT302package`, or similar. Please don't go with `YOURPACKAGENAME`.

Congratulations, you have developed an R package! Let's go through what we just created.

---
# Package file content

.middler[<img src="packagefiles.png" alt="" height="300"/>]

---

# .gitignore: Files git ignores (*)

The `.gitignore` file specifies which files git will ignore and not track. devtools puts `.Rproj.user` there by default, a helper file associated with your project file. Typically, you don't want to do version control on things like your history, so I usually add `.Rhistory`.
This is unnecessary, but recommended.

When you add files here (which you don't need to do often, if at all), add them on new lines!

.center[<img src="gitignore.png" alt="" height="100"/>]

---

# .Rbuildignore: Files R build ignores

The `.Rbuildignore` file specifies which files will be ignored when you build your package. 
devtools puts R project files there by default, because the project files are for you, the developer, not a user of your package!

Typically, you won't need to edit this by hand.

---

# Step 2: DESCRIPTION metadata (*)

The `DESCRIPTION` file is a space for package metadata.
Go ahead and fill in the relevant information now.
We will come back to this file shortly.

For `License`, I recommend either `GPL-3` or `MIT`. Do not use Creative Commons (`CC`) for software.
I like Karl Broman's overview of licenses [here](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/licenses.html).
If you use `MIT`, make sure you include a `LICENSE` file with the year and copywrite holder as well!
See the link for an example.


.center[<img src="description.png" alt="" height="300"/>]

---

# NAMESPACE: Package namespace

The `NAMESPACE` file is a space for the package namespace.
For the most part, this  tells R what functions your package exports.
It is also used to list function imports as well as some other more advanced topics we won't get into in this class, such as S3 methods.

Fortunately, with devtools you don't have to (and shouldn't!) ever edit this file by hand!

---
layout: true

# Step 3: The R Folder (*)

---

Now that we've been introduced to every file that was created by `devtools::create()`, we are ready to give our package some functions!

Open a new R script and write the following simple function.

```{r}
my_pow <- function(x, power = 2) {
  return(x^power)
}
```


Save this R script within the R folder as `my_pow.R`.


---

Now open **another** new R script and write the following simple function.

```{r}
f_to_c <- function(temp_F) {
  temp_C <- (temp_F - 32) * 5 / 9
  return(temp_C)
}
```

Save this R script within the R folder as `f_to_c.R`.

**Best practice:** Each R script should include a single R function, and the name of the `.R` file should match the name of the function!
Get in the habit of doing this now and you will thank yourself later.
It will make version control with R packages much cleaner and easier.

.sectionhead[Part 2. Documenting a package]

---
layout: true

# Step 4: Add documentation (*)
---

We now have functions within our package, but they are incomplete because they lack **documentation**. 
Documentation is what you see when you type something like `?lm`.

Of course, style matters a lot when it comes to documentation!
This is the user-facing part of your code, so following proper style guidelines is crucial (and graded)! 
As usual, we will follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/documentation.html).

---

## Title and description

For package documentation using the `roxygen2` package (built in to `devtools` workflow), we write comments a special way.
When documenting functions, we use `#'` rather than just `#` for the comments. 
Always indent one space after `#'` to begin documentation.

The first documentation line should be the title of the function. This should not end with a full stop `.`. 
Then you should skip a line, and then write the function description.
This is often similar to the title, but with more details.
It should end with a full stop.

---

## Parameters

Next, we document **all** parameters of a function.
We proceed the documentation with `@param`, then a space, then the parameter name, then another space, then the description.

In general, write the documentation as a sentence. Starting with a capital letter and ending with a full stop `.`. 
Include the type of data input expected as well as the default value, if applicable.

To refer to other parameters or value of code, wrap the text in `\code{TEXT}`.
For long lines of documentation, begin a new line and indent an extra 2 spaces.

.center[<img src="temp2.png" alt="" height="200"/>]

---

## Keywords

If relevant, add keywords to your functions using `@keywords`
These are useful if you have several functions that have a similar topic. 
For example, maybe we have several temperature related functions:

.center[<img src="temp22.png" alt="" height="220"/>]

---

## Return

Document what your function returns using `@return`. 
Documentation style for `@return` follows `@param` (sentence with full stop).
Always describe the full structure of your output ("A list with elements \code{...}...", "a vector of...", etc.).

---

## Examples

All functions should include at least one example demonstrating how to use the function.
Proceed the example by `@examples`, then on new documentation lines indented with 
a single space, write R code exactly as you would in the console demonstrating the function.

## Export

Lastly, if you want your function to visible to the user, add an `@export` tag just before the first line of your function. 
In general, most functions you write should have this tag, unless you want the function to be used internally only.

# Step 5: Build documentation (*)

If you've been following the instructions so far, devtools makes this step almost trivial.
In your console, run the command

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::document()
```

Let's look at what changed.

---

# The man folder: manual files

The poorly-named `man` folder should now exist in your package directory.
Look inside, and you should see a `.Rd` file for every function you've documented.
These files are written in a markdown language, and never need to be (or should be!) edited by hand!

Make sure that any time you change even a single character in your documentation, 
you update the documentation with `devtools::document()`.
R will get confused if the documentation within the `.R` files doesn't **exactly** match the documentation that appears within the `.Rd` files.

---

# NAMESPACE: namespace

Look at the `NAMESPACE` again, and you will see an exported line for every function with an `@export` tag.
Like the `man` folder, this files never need to be edited by hand!

---
layout: true
# Install! (*)
---

Next, move into the parent directory that contains your package (should be one directory up), and install using `devtools::install()`.
Then load your package, like any other, using `library()`. 
Then check out the documentation of your functions using `?`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("..")
devtools::install("YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME")
library(YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME)
?my_pow
```

# Step 5.5: Check your package (*)

Anytime you update a package, it's a good idea to check it.
This can be done in two ways.

1. In the console, type `devtools::check()`
  * If you get an error that says `Error: Could not find package root.`, then you need to navigate to the package working directory (not the directory that *contains* your package, for example)
2. Open the `Build` pane, then click `Check`

If you have no errors, warnings, or notes, then your package passed standard checks!

.sectionhead[Part 3: Github and R packages]
---

# Step 6: Create a Github repo (*)

Using steps from week 7 lecture slides, set up a repository on Github. 
Make sure **not** to select *Initialize this repository with a README*.
The repo name **must** match the name of the package!

---

# Step 7: Connect git with R (*)

1. Open your console
2. **Navigate your working directory to your package folder** 
  * Confirm this using `pwd` and `ls`, it should be the folder that includes the .Rproj file
3. `git init`: set up get
4. `git status`: confirm the files look like you expect
5. `git add .`: adds git tracking for all files not in `.gitignore`
6. `git status`: confirm, as always
7. `git commit -m "Set up package"` or similar message to commit your changes
8. `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME.git`: connect your Github repo to your local git with nickname origin
9. `git push -u origin master` to push your local changes to origin

Now navigate online to your Github repo link. 
You should see your package hosted!

---

# Install from Github! (*)

Installing from Github is simple! Just use `devtools::install_github()`!
Try installing your own package.
If that works, try installing your neighbor's package!

Fill in the username and link with your own information:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("bryandmartin/Demo")
library(Demo)
?my_pow
```

---

# Step 8: Set up a travis CI account (*)

Instructions from the official [travis CI tutorial](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/).

1. Go to [travis-ci.com](travis-ci.com) and click `Sign up with Github`
2. Accept the Authorization of Travis CI. You'll be redirected to GitHub.
3. Click on your profile picture in the top right of your Travis Dashboard, click the green *Activate* button, and select the repositories you want to use with Travis CI.
  * In this case, select your package for Project 3.
  
---

# Step 9: Set up travis within your package (*)

1. Within your console, enter `use_this::use_testthat()`. This will:
  * Create a `tests/testthat` directory for storing your tests
  * Adds `testthat` to the `Suggests` field within `DESCRIPTION`
  * Creates `tests/testthat.R` which runs your tests automatically whenever you check your package.
2. Within your console, enter `usethis::use_travis()`. This will:
  * Create a `.travis.yml` file and add it to your `.gitignore`
  * Push you to the travis website.
  * Provide the markdown to insert a badge into `README`.
3. Activate travis for your repo at the travis website.
4. *File -> New File -> Text File*
  * Take the markdown text from `use_travis()` output and save as `README.md`. You **must** change the file extension!
5. Push your local changes to Github using instructions from Lecture Slide 7.
  * Recall: Easy way - through RStudio!

# Step 10: Add automated tests (*)
---

The organization of tests should match the organization of R files.
Thus, for every `.R` file within our R folder, we should have a corresponding file within `tests/testthat`.

1. Run `usethis::use_test("my_pow")`. This will automatically create and open `tests/testthat/test-my_pow.R`.
2. Edit the test file. Let's test whether both inputs are numeric, and add a second test that it works mathematically on some example input.
  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
  # within test-my_pow.R
  test_that("my_pow works mathmatically", {
    expect_equal(my_pow(2), 4)
    expect_equal(my_pow(2, power = 3), 8)
  })
  
  test_that("non-numeric input throws error", {
    expect_error(my_pow("a string"))
    expect_error(my_pow(2, power = "a string"))
  })
  ```
3. Run `devtools::check()`. Does your code pass the checks?

---

Let's repeat the process with `f_to_c`.

1. Run `usethis::use_test("f_to_c")`
2. Edit the test file. Let's again test a few input values and that non-numeric input breaks.
  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
  # within test-f_to_c.R
  test_that("f_to_c works mathmatically", {
    expect_equal(f_to_c(32), 0)
    expect_equal(f_to_c(212), 100)
  })
  
  test_that("non-numeric input throws error", {
    expect_error(f_to_c("a string"))
  })
  ```
3. Run `devtools::check()`. Does your code pass the checks?
4. Push your changes to your remote repository on Github.

Now go to the [travis-ci.com](travis-ci.com) and click on your repository. What is happening?

# Step 11: Add code coverage (*)

Thanks to the tidyverse authors, adding code coverage is easy! (Are you sensing a theme yet?)

1. Navigate online to `codecov.io` and create an account. Link this account with your Github account.
2. Run `usethis::use_coverage()`. This will:
  * Add `covr` to the `Suggests` field within `DESCRIPTION`
  * Create `codecov.yml` and add it to `.Rbuildignore`
  * Add a Codecov test coverage badge to `README.md`
  * Provide text to add to `.travis.yml`
3. Take the text it generated and add it on a new line to your `.travis.yml`. (It should be automatically copied to your clipboard.)
