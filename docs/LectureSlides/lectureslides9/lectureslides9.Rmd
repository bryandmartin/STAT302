# Why?

.middler[
repeating a task : writing a function ::
writing a function : writing a package
]

---

* repeating a task : writing a function ::
writing a function : writing a package
* If you find yourself copying R code from one script file to another, it's probably worth it to write a package!
* Copying and pasting code as part of your workflow is **bad** practice!

# Getting Started (*)

First, we need to make sure you have the proper packages installed.
Remember, do this step only once!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr"))
```

---

# Step 1: Create the directory (*)

1. Within your `STAT302` directory, go to your folder for projects
2. Create a new subdirectory, `Project3` (or similar)
3. **Change your working directory within R to your `Project3` subfolder!**
4. Type in your R console (changing the package name)
  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
  devtools::create("YOURPACKAGENAME")
  ```
  I don't care what you name your package. Unless you feel particularly inspired, feel free to go for `myfirstpackage`, `STAT302package`, or similar. Please don't go with `YOURPACKAGENAME`.

Congratulations, you have developed an R package! Let's go through what we just created.

# Package file content

.middler[<img src="packagefiles.png" alt="" height="300"/>]

---

# .gitignore: Files git ignores (*)

The `.gitignore` file specifies which files git will ignore and not track. devtools puts `.Rproj.user` there by default, a helper file associated with your project file. Typically, you don't want to do version control on things like your history, so I usually add `.Rhistory`.
This is unnecessary, but recommended.

When you add files here (which you don't need to do often, if at all), add them on new lines!

---

# .Rbuildignore: Files R build ignores

The `.Rbuildignore` file specifies which files will be ignored when you build your package. 
devtools puts R project files there by default, because the project files are for you, the developer, not a user of your package!

Typically, you won't need to edit this by hand.

---

# Step 2: DESCRIPTION metadata (*)

The `DESCRIPTION` file is a space for package metadata.
Go ahead and fill in the relevant information now.
We will come back to this file shortly.

For `License`, I recommend either `GPL-3` or `MIT`. Do not use Creative Commons (`CC`) for software.
I like Karl Broman's overview of licenses [here](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/licenses.html).
If you use `MIT`, make sure you include a `LICENSE` file with the year and copywrite holder as well!
See the link for an example.

# NAMESPACE: Package namespace

The `NAMESPACE` file is a space for the package namespace.
For the most part, this  tells R what functions your package exports.
It is also used to list function imports as well as some other more advanced topics we won't get into in this class, such as S3 methods.

Fortunately, with devtools you don't have to (and shouldn't!) ever edit this file by hand!

# Step 3: The R Folder (*)

---

Now that we've been introduced to every file that was created by `devtools::create()`, we are ready to give our package some functions!

Open a new R script and write the following simple function.

```{r}
my_pow <- function(x, power = 2) {
  return(x^power)
}
```


Save this R script within the R folder as `my_pow.R`.


---

Now open **another** new R script and write the following simple function.

```{r}
f_to_c <- function(temp_F) {
  temp_C <- (temp_F - 32) * 5 / 9
  return(temp_C)
}
```

Save this R script within the R folder as `f_to_c.R`.

**Best practice:** Each R script should include a single R function, and the name of the `.R` file should match the name of the function!
Get in the habit of doing this now and you will thank yourself later.
It will make version control with R packages much cleaner and easier.

---
layout: true

# Step 4: Add documentation (*)
---

We now have functions within our package, but they are incomplete because they lack **documentation**. 
Documentation is what you see when you type something like `?lm`.

Of course, style matters a lot when it comes to documentation!
This is the user-facing part of your code, so following proper style guidelines is crucial (and graded)! 
As usual, we will follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/documentation.html).
